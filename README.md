## Background Removal Algorithm

The tool uses an advanced algorithm to remove white backgrounds:

1. **Luminance Analysis**: Calculates pixel brightness
2. **Local Mean Comparison**: Compares each pixel to its local neighborhood
3. **Saturation Filtering**: Preserves colored ink while removing white
4. **Blue Ink Boost**: Special handling for blue ink signatures
5. **Feathering**: Smooth transitions for natural-looking edges

### Adjustable Parameters
- **Saturation Threshold**: How much color to preserve
- **Feather Start/End**: Transition zone boundaries
- **Local Window**: Neighborhood size for analysis
- **Blue Ink Boost**: Special treatment for blue signatures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Please select both a PDF and an image"**
- Ensure both files are selected before clicking "Add Signature & Download"

**Signature appears too small/large**
- Use the size controls in Step 3 to adjust width and height
- Enable "Maintain aspect ratio" for proportional scaling

**Background removal not working well**
- Adjust the saturation threshold (try values between 0.15-0.35)
- Modify feather start/end values (try 0.80-0.95)
- Increase local window size for textured paper

**PDF download not starting**
- Check if your browser blocks pop-ups
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space
- Try a different browser if issues persist

**Error: attempting to access detached ArrayBuffer (Split/Download)**
- Reload the page and open the PDF again; the app keeps a persistent copy internally
- Make sure to use the `Open PDF` button before `Split`

**PDF rendering not visible (Editor/Advanced)**
- Ensure internet access for the CDN of PDF.js
- If using offline environment, replace CDN with local copies of `pdf.min.js` and `pdf.worker.min.js`

### Performance Tips

- Use PNG images for signatures with transparency
- Keep PDF file sizes under 20MB for best performance
- Use JPG for signatures without transparency needs
- Close other browser tabs if processing large files
